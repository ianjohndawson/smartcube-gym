# HANDOFF.md — status + remaining work

The repository audit (`AUDIT.md`) has been worked through on a real machine.
**Read `CLAUDE.md` first** for durable architecture, build/verify commands, and
guardrails. Run `npm run build` + `npm run check` (expect 0 mismatches) after each
change.

## Done (2026-06)

- **Step 1** — deleted dead `src/solver.ts`; removed the `(e as any)` casts in
  `bluetooth.ts`; added `src/storage.ts` (centralised, validated, prefixed,
  per-device MAC) + `scripts/storage-check.ts` (13/13).
- **M2** — test oracles moved to `scripts/oracles.ts`; dead facade exports removed
  (`maskProgressState`, `statesEqual`, `maskProgressFromHistory`, `nearestMask`);
  `cube.ts` annotated (it's both an app dep via `KOCIEMBA_FACELET_COORDS` and a
  harness oracle — not dead).
- **M4** — `tsconfig.scripts.json` + `npm run check`; the validation harnesses
  carry CI exit codes and run in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` before build/deploy.
- **M5** — the engine-boundary casts collapsed into one `cubeFromFaceletArray`
  helper (and the spurious `homePermutation` casts removed).
- **H2 (steps 1–4)** — `main.ts` carved into `theme.ts`, `dom.ts`, `stats.ts`,
  `eo-axis.ts` (~2,110 → ~1,720 lines). Pure moves, build-verified after each.
- **Multi-cube Bluetooth** — swapped `gan-web-bluetooth` for
  `smartcube-web-bluetooth` (GAN/MoYu/QiYi/Giiker/GoCube); per-device MAC cache +
  MoYu32 address search. MoYu Super Weilong v2 (`WCU_MY32`) verified on hardware.
- **EO axis modes** simplified to `detect`/`gb`/`ro` (dropped `ask` + `auto` and
  their gesture/prompt machinery; fixed a stray prompt that showed in detect mode).
- **CI / deps hygiene** — runner bumped to Node 22 with current action versions
  (the Node-20 deprecation warning is cleared); `smartcube-web-bluetooth` pinned to
  a commit (`44f1f09`) for reproducible builds.
- **EO review hands-free retry** — a 4× side-face spin (F/B/R/L) retries the case,
  mirroring the U/D advance gesture; the review loop is now hands-off bar Discard.

## Remaining — TODO

### H2 step 5 — `view/` extraction (deferred; NOT a pure move)
The ~18 `buildXxx()` panel builders in `main.ts` are bound to module-scope
`state`, `render()`, `cube` and dozens of handlers. Extracting them needs a
**state-context refactor first** — lift `state`/`render`/`cube`/the handler set
into a shared module that both `main` and `view/` import. Behaviour-risky (not a
pure move), so left as a deliberate follow-up.

### Low priority (from the audit)
- Match build targets: vite `es2020` vs tsconfig `ES2022` (`vite.config.ts`).
- Enable `noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters` (auto-catches orphaned imports;
  exclude `src/engine/`).
- Gate the `window.gym` debug hook behind `import.meta.env.DEV`.
- A `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` pass (~84 fixes; worthwhile for index-heavy code).
- `npm audit`: esbuild/vite **dev-server-only** advisory; fix is a Vite major — defer.

### Method / feature roadmap (Ian's, longer-term)
- Roux LSE-EO needs a separate **M/U engine EO axis** (engine EO is F/B only) — the
  main blocker for a real Roux path.
- EOLine / EOCross have separate pre-existing known issues.
- Curated worked-example cases (Petrus PDF); colour-neutral tier; ZZ/LEOR/APB journeys.

## Guardrails (also in CLAUDE.md)
- **Don't edit `src/engine/`** (vendored, MPL-2.0) beyond import paths.
- **Grep `scripts/` before deleting any "unused" symbol** — it may be an oracle.
- **Keep every harness at 0 mismatches**; add one when adding a non-trivial algorithm.
- **Don't pipe `tsc` through `head`** (SIGPIPE undercounts errors) — redirect to a file.
- **BLE can't be tested without hardware** — verify cube changes live with the
  in-app event log; don't ship blind BLE changes.
- All `localStorage` access goes through `src/storage.ts`.
